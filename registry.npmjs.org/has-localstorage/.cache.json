Unfortunately,\nSauce Labs has no support to start browsers in private mode, which would\nbe necessary, as `localStorage` behaves different if in private mode\nin Safari, probably in other browsers as well.\n\nIf anynone has an idea to for that, ping me at\nhttps://github.com/gr2m/has-localstorage/issues/1\n\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\n`hasLocalStorage()` has been inspired by this [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/) commit:\nhttps://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/063b05d9643c35b303568a28809e4eb3224f71ec\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"gr2m","email":"gregor@martynus.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-01-03T11:04:19.455Z","created":"2015-01-02T14:57:27.798Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-02T14:57:27.798Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-03T11:04:19.455Z"},"homepage":"http://gr2m.github.com/has-localstorage","keywords":["localstorage","browser","data"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/gr2m/has-localstorage"},"author":{"name":"Gregor Martynus"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gr2m/has-localstorage/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"6RCGJ5EUA15UZ5EKDYTJ7DMOO\""}
