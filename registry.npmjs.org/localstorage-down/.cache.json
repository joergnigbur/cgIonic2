localstorage-down [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/No9/localstorage-down.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/No9/localstorage-down) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/No9/localstorage-down/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/No9/localstorage-down?branch=master)\n\nLocalStorage implementation of [leveldown](https://github.com/Level/leveldown) for mobile and desktop browsers. The idea is to be able to use the [level](http://github.com/level) stack on any browser that supports LocalStorage.\n\nThe scenarios envisaged are:\n\n1. Occasionally connected clients\n2. Ad-hoc networks where clients need to sync directly with each other\n\nThis project is intended for use with the [level eco-system](https://github.com/level/).\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install localstorage-down\n```\n\n## Browser support\n\nBasically we support [any browser that has LocalStorage](http://caniuse.com/namevalue-storage), but since we also rely on an ES5 environment due to dependencies from [abstract-leveldown](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown), in practice you will need the following shims in order to work correctly on all browsers (e.g. IE 8-9, Android 2.3):\n\n* [typedarray](https://github.com/substack/typedarray) for binary storage\n* [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim) for just about everything\n\nWe run [automated tests](http://travis-ci.org/No9/localstorage-down) in the following browsers:\n\n* **Firefox**: 40-latest\n* **Chrome**: 44-beta\n* **IE**: 9-11\n* **Edge**: latest\n* **Safari**: 7.0-latest\n* **iPhone**: 8.0-latest\n* **Android**: 4.1-latest\n\nIn environments without LocalStorage, such as Node or Safari private browsing, this module\nwill fall back to a temporary in-memory implementation, thanks to [humble-localstorage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humble-localstorage).\n\n## Example \n\nAt the command prompt in your chosen directory : \n\n    npm install localstorage-down\n    npm install levelup \n    npm install browserify -g\n    npm install beefy -g\n\nCreate a file called `index.js` and enter the following:\n\n```js\nvar localstorage = require('localstorage-down');\nvar levelup = require('levelup');\nvar db = levelup('dbname', { db: localstorage });\n\ndb.put('name', 'James Dean');\ndb.put('dob', 'February 8, 1931');\ndb.put('occupation', 'Rebel');\ndb.put('cause', 'none');\n\ndb.readStream()\n   .on('data', function (data) {\n      if (typeof data.value !== 'undefined') {\n         console.log(data.key, '=', data.value);\n      }\n   })\n   .on('error', function (err) {\n      console.log('Oh my!', err);\n   })\n   .on('close', function () {\n      console.log('Stream closed');\n   })\n   .on('end', function () {\n     console.log('Stream ended');\n   });\n```\n\nPublish the site :\n\n    beefy index.js\n\nSee the output :\n\n[http://localhost:9966](http://localhost:9966)\n\nListen to John Cage:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hVFCmK6GgM\n\n## Tests\n\n    npm run test\n\nThis will run tests in Node against `localstorage-memory`. \n\nTo test in Saucelabs, you can run e.g.:\n\n    BROWSER_NAME=firefox BROWSER_VERSION=\"38..latest\" npm run test-saucelabs\n\nOr to test in Zuul locally:\n\n    npm run test-zuul-local\n\nTo test and check code coverage, run:\n\n    npm run coverage\n\nTo test and report code coverage to Coveralls, run:\n\n    npm run report-coverage\n\n##  Contributors\n\n* [Anton Whalley](https://github.com/no9)\n* [Adam Shih](https://github.com/adamshih)\n* [Nolan Lawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson)\n* [Many more!](https://github.com/No9/localstorage-down/graphs/contributors)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"adamshih","email":"ashih18@gmail.com"},{"name":"no9","email":"anton@venshare.com"},{"name":"nolanlawson","email":"nolan@nolanlawson.com"},{"name":"tenaciousmv","email":"mark.vayngrib@lablz.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-25T13:45:22.703Z","created":"2014-01-30T02:47:11.844Z","0.4.0":"2014-01-30T02:47:11.844Z","0.4.1":"2014-03-27T21:36:54.326Z","0.4.2":"2014-04-08T22:56:47.822Z","0.4.3":"2014-04-24T23:49:12.197Z","0.4.4":"2014-04-29T22:30:33.223Z","0.5.0":"2014-05-14T16:55:39.687Z","0.5.1":"2014-05-16T21:07:54.248Z","0.5.2":"2014-05-20T00:22:03.030Z","0.6.0":"2014-05-26T16:53:37.685Z","0.6.1":"2014-08-28T17:21:41.685Z","0.6.2":"2014-10-15T19:15:48.685Z","0.6.3":"2014-10-19T18:28:05.536Z","0.6.4":"2015-12-06T23:46:56.926Z","0.6.5":"2015-12-20T22:07:33.505Z","0.6.6":"2016-01-25T13:45:22.703Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/no9/localstorage-down#readme","keywords":["leveldb","localstorage","leveldown","levelup"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/no9/localstorage-down.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Anton Whalley","email":"antonwhalley@vodafone.ie","url":"https://github.com/no9"},{"name":"Adam Shih","url":"https://github.com/adamshih"},{"name":"Nolan Lawson","url":"https://github.com/nolanlawson"}],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/no9/localstorage-down/issues"},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"7E4E5UXF3GU96PNJ46KQCL6EJ\""}
