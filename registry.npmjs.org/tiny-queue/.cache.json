It's implemented in the straightforward `root -> node1 -> node2 -> etc.`\narchitecture that we all remember from CS 101.\n\nThis can typically be used as a drop-in replacement for an array, and it's only 38 lines of code.\n\n### Status\n\n[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/nolanlawson/tiny-queue.png)](https://ci.testling.com/nolanlawson/tiny-queue)\n\n### Usage\n\n```\nnpm install tiny-queue\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```js\nvar Queue = require('tiny-queue');\nvar queue = new Queue();\n\nqueue.push('foo');\nqueue.push('bar');\nqueue.shift(); // 'foo'\nqueue.shift(); //'bar'\nqueue.length; // 0\nqueue.shift(); // undefined\n```\n\n### API\n\nThe returned `Queue` object, once instantiated, only supports\nfour operations:\n\n```js\nqueue.push()\nqueue.shift()\nqueue.slice() // returns a regular Array\nqueue.length\n```\n\nSo it's basically a drop-in replacement for most na&iuml;ve usages\nof an array as a queue.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nolanlawson","email":"nolan@nolanlawson.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-11T02:14:17.200Z","created":"2014-05-23T02:26:37.349Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-23T02:26:37.349Z","0.2.0":"2014-05-23T03:03:54.426Z","0.2.1":"2014-08-11T02:14:17.200Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nolanlawson/tiny-queue","keywords":["queue","fifo"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/nolanlawson/tiny-queue.git"},"author":{"name":"Nolan Lawson","email":"nolan.lawson@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nolanlawson/tiny-queue/issues"},"license":"Apache 2","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"AAGM9VKNCQLDH7KBKQDKGI7YI\"","_cached":true}
